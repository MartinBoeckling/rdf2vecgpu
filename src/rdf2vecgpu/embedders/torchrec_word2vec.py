"""Torchrec-backed sharded Word2Vec training.

See docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-26-torchrec-sharded-embeddings-design.md

All torchrec / fbgemm imports happen *inside* function bodies so this
module can be imported without those extras installed (the import-time
check in :func:`train_torchrec_word2vec` is what surfaces the error).
